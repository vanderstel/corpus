Find a wheel, and it goes round, round, round,
As it skims along with a happy sound,
As it goes, along the ground, ground, ground,
'Till it leads you to the one you love

Then your love, will hold you round, round, round,
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound,
And your head, goes spinning round, round, round,
'Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of

In the night you see the oval moon,
Goin' round and round in tune.
And the ball of sun in the day,
Makes a girl and boy wanna say

Find a ring, and put it round, round, round,
And with ties so strong the two hearts are bound,
Put it on, the one you found, found, found,
For you know that this is really love

Really love really love hmmm
