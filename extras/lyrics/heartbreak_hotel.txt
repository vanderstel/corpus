Well, since my baby left me, well I found a new place to dwell
Well it's down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel
Well I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby, well I'm so lonely, I'll be so lonely I could die

Although it's always crowded, you still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers to cry there in gloom, I'll be so
It make you so lonely baby, it make you so lonely, oh they're so lonely they could die

Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing and the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they been so long on Lonely Street, they'll never they'll never look back
It make you so, it make you so lonely baby, well they're so lonely, well they're so lonely they could die

Well if your baby leaves you and you've got a tale to tell
Well just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel
Where you will be, it will make you so lonely baby
Well you will be lonely, you'll be so lonely you could die

Although it's always crowded, well you still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers to cry there in gloom, I'll be so
It make you so lonely baby, well they're so lonely, they'll be so lonely they could die
