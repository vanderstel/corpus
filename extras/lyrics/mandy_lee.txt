I got out and saw ya
Yes I did
And I saw you with a gal
Couldn't help but see ya
Yes I knew ya
Who was that Who was that
Lady with you
Don't you know I know her
Yes I do
She was once my sister's pal
You don't know that gal is bred thorough bred
Come ahead listen to me

When me and Mandy hit that ballroom floor and I remove myself of cares
And then we one-step, two-step
Slip and slide
I'm always happy when I'm by her side
And when they play that music oh so sweet and with the closest harmony

/*
Can't hear some words in the following line
*/
All is well for la la la la me and my Mandy Lee

Like to have you meet her
Yes I would
She'd be glad to see you too
She is some good-looker
Some good cooker
Move along come along up to the house

/*
Can't hear some words in the following line
*/
Well if you like home cookin' la la la
We can suit you to a tee

/*
Can't hear some words in the following line
*/
After soup and fishing all days la la
Come with my Mandy and me

When me and Mandy hit that ballroom floor and I remove myself of cares
And then we one-step two-step
Slip and slide
I'm always happy when I'm by her side
And when they play that music oh so sweet and with the closest harmony

/*
Can't hear some words in the following line
*/
All is well for la la la la me and my Mandy Lee

SPOKEN

Listen, Henry. What tune is that?
What tune is what?
Why the tune the orchestra is playing.
Oh, why that's Mandy Lee.
Well is she any relation to your Mandy Lee?
Oh yes, in a way, but I ain't never figured out just how closely related they is 'cause I was only interestedly concerned in my own Mandy.
-- laughter --
Why naturally, of course. Can she dance?
Sure she can.
Well does she dance the Machawch?
The what?
The Machooch.
I didn't get ya.
Why you know, the Mach-ouch.
Oh, you mean the Mawcheech!
Sure, that's what I said.
-- laughter --
Well I should say she could. You watch the both of us now.
