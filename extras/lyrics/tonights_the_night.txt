Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour ya a good long drink
Ooh baby don't you hesitate cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Come on angel my hearts on fire(1)
Don't deny your man's desire(1)
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
