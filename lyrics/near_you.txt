% Near You (1947)


There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be, near you
Times when we're apart
I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away

If my life could be spent near you
I'd be more than content near you
Make my wish come true
By telling me that you
Want to spend all your days near me
