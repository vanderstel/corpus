Alone alone with the sky of romance above
Alone alone on a night that was meant for love
There must be someone waiting who feels the way I do
Whoever you are are you are you

Alone alone on this night that we too shall share
alone alone with you kiss that could make me care
and when you come I promise to be your very own
Alone alone with a heart meant for you alone
